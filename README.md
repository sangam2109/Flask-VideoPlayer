### 3. Embedding the Video Player

To embed the video player into your Flask application, follow these steps:

2. Use the `render_template` function in your Flask routes to render the `plyr.html` template with the appropriate video file name:

```python
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/video_page')
def video_page():
    return render_template('plyr.html', vid_name='your_video.mp4')
```

3. Ensure your video file is stored in the `videos` folder within your Flask application directory.

### 4. Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the video player by modifying the `plyr.html` template and the associated CSS and JavaScript files. Refer to the Plyr documentation for more details: [Plyr Documentation](https://plyr.io/documentation)
